            What started as a little "what if..." has quickly grown to a
            community of hundreds of passionate people learning together and
            supporting each other.

            The idea for Dev Together came while reviewing applications for my
            company's apprenticeship program and realizing that there is a
            tremendous need for continued support and learning while trying to
            land your first dev job. I mentioned the idea in Slack and was
            instantly met with an enthusiasm I was not prepared for. This
            enthusiasm has come to define our first year of Dev Together. This
            community has become what it is because of all of you, your
            enthusiasm for learning, and your commitment to each other. I'm
            honestly blown away every month by what you all accomplish.

            Over this past year, I've seen some really incredible pairing
            sessions, overheard conversations about interview tips and
            negotiating job offers, and I've received some amazing messages from
            those of you who have landed your first dev job and officially get
            to put "Software Developer" on your LinkedIn.{" "}

            This past year has been nothing short of amazing, and I am so
            excited for what the next year holds. I want to continue to grow our
            community so we can support even more early-career devs through our
            Code Review & Pairing events as well as workshops. And I want to
            amplify more of the voices within our community. Be on the lookout
            for guest blogging, roundtable discussions, and more
            speaking/workshop opportunities from Dev Together this year.
